I enjoyed implementing functionality in websites through node.js with the course on [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). These are the github repositories with my solutions for the projects [Timestamp Microservice](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-TimestampService), [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-HeaderparserService), [URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-UrlShortenerService), [Exercise Tracker Microservice](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-ExerciseTrackerService), [File Metadata Microservice](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-FileMetadataService).
