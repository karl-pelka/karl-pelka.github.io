I worked through the material on [Data Visualization](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and learned how to generate interactive visuals through this course. My github repository with codes for all projects can be found [here](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC_DataVisualization).
