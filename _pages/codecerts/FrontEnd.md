I learned about front end development mostly with React on the course [Front End Development Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). My github repository with codes for all projects can be found [here](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC_FrontEndLibraries).
