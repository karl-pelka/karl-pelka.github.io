I worked through the material on [Information Security](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) and went through the back end projects. These are the github repositories for the projects [Stock Price Checker](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-StockPriceCheck), [Anonymous Message Board](https://github.com/karl-pelka/fcc-anonymousmessageboard), [Port Scanner](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-portscanner), [SHA-1 Password Cracker](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-SHA1-Cracker), and [Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC_Secure-Real-Time-Multiplayer-Game).
