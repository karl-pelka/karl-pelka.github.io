I took some time to keep up to date in Python with the course on [College Algebra with Python](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/Karl_Pelka/college-algebra-with-python-v8) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). My github repository with codes for all projects can be found [here](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC_CollegeAlgebraWithPython).
