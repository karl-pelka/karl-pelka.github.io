I learned how to set up tests for back end code on the course on [Quality Assurance](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/) at [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). These are the github repositories with my solutions for the projects [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-MetricImperialConversion), [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-IssueTracker), [Personal Library](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-PersonalLibrary), [Sudoko Solver](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-SudokuSolver), [American British Translater](https://github.com/karl-pelka/FCC-AmericanBritishTranslator).
