In 2025, I took some time to do my Deco 50 training at [Diveshack](https://www.divemalta.com). It was definitely a huge leap from a recreational diver where there is always heaps of error margin with every dive to every error can cause serious trouble. Being an entry level tech diver, it is now time to get much more experience in tech diving before moving on. I am really eager to go practice.
