I got the chance to present our latest work on "Routing entanglement through quantum networks" at the GRC on "Mechanical systems in the quantum regime 2024" in Ventura, California.

I learned about squeezing by Mark Dykman during enriching discussions on our work; I got enlightened about the spin-2 nature of the graviton during discussions with Daniel Carney; and I got to see some highlight talks among which Florian Marquardt discussed artificial scientific discovery, Uros Delic showed his experimental progress on Nonreciprocity in optical tweezer arrays, and Warwick Bowen discussed nonlinear waves not only in wavetanks but also in superfluid optomechanics.
