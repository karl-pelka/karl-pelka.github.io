I was asked to take on the role as copy editor for [Xjenza Online](https://www.xjenza.org), the scientific journal of the Malta Chamber of Scientists. I am looking forward to working with the Editors Cristiana Sebu and Jackson Said to release the papers of the exciting research being performed nationally and internationally by Maltese scholars, and to provide a launching platform into scientific publishing for a wide scope of potential authors, including students and young researchers, in a peer-reviewed environment.

I will post as soon as the first edition that was typeset by me sees the light of day.
