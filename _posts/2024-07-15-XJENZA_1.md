The first issue, [Xjenza Online Vol. 12 Special Issue (Economics and Finance)](https://www.xjenza.org/Xjenza-Online-Vol-12-Special-Issue-Economics-and-Finance_J_11.html), that I took care of as copy editor is now online. The local experts on economics and finance discuss diverse topics, such as house purchase affordability in Malta, core inflation, and retirement savings among others. I am proud of this first effort as copy editor for Xjenza Online and I am looking forward to many more articles to finish.
