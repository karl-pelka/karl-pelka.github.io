The last 2024 issue of Xjenza Online, [Xjenza Online Vol. 12 Issue 2](https://www.xjenza.org/Xjenza-Online-Vol-12-Issue-2_J_13.html), is now online. The topics in this issue are again a mixed bag of different disciplines covering healthcare, English language use at European universities, Sociology, and many more. I am simply flattered by the nice words in the editorial by the Editor-in-Chief, Prof. Cristiana Sebu. I can only say thank you for having me on the team. Let's keep the issues coming in 2025.
