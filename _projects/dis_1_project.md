    A theoretical computation of the so-called "Talbot-carpet".
</div>

On this [occasion](https://worldquantumday.org/events/quantum-mechanics-in-malta/), our group gave an overview of our research and I gave a short talk about the number theoretic relations in the Talbot carpet. The intensity pattern of the Talbot effect being described by Gauss Sums means that on the single photon level, photons like to accumulate at certain places that indicate if a test factor p is a divisor of the number to be factored N. Note that on the same event, no other than to-be Nobel laureate Alain Aspect gave [a wonderful lecture](https://worldquantumday.org/events/from-einstein-to-wheeler-wave-particle-duality-of-a-single-photon/) on the wave-particle duality of single photons as well.
