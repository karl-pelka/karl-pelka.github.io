2020 marked the year that Google made the news all over the world with their Sycamore chip and claim to achieve quantum supremacy. Our group was asked to write an explanation for the layman which gave me the chance to write this [article](https://timesofmalta.com/article/a-quantum-leap-for-a-machine-but-a-giant-step-for-mankind.774818) for the Times of Malta. The article gives a simplified explanation for what quantum computers do and a brief assessment of the situation.
