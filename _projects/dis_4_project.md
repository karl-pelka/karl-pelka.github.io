The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Arthur Ashkin in 2018 ["for groundbreaking inventions in laser physics."](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2018/summary/) This topic is near and dear to my heart as it employs and depicts radiation pressure, the fundamental mechanism of optomechanics which I explored in my Doctoral studies, in a tangible manner and enables many applications in biology. Our group was able to write an  [article](https://timesofmalta.com/article/orchestrating-light-and-controlling-matter-with-optical-tweezers.696305) for the Times of Malta. The article lays out the principle of radiation pressure and the title picture is a wonderful reenactment of the Ashkin's explanation (See Fig. 2 [here](https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.24.156)) for the optical gradient force.
