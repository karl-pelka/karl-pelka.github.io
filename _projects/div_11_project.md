Just around Malta's capital Valletta you have the opportunity to go to St. Elmos Bay where you can explore the HMS Maori. It is a wonderful wreck which is mostly decomposed by now but still offers a lot to see.

Apart from the flying gurnards and octopus that I've seen here, I've meet this curious buddy.

Apart from that the HMS Maori offers a good glimpse at why you want to go for wreck diving as a beginner as my wife finished her Open Water Course here

This is a freshly certified Open Water Diver and another diver, can you guess who is who? If I didn't know, I couldn't ;)
