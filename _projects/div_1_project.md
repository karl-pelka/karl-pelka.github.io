To not get totally rusty, I decided to take a good friend with me to practice our dive skills. We went to Divers-Indoor close to the Munich Airport in Oberding, Germany. It was a great experience with great rental equipment. There are many different sections with platforms, obstacles and mini habitats. I can definitely recommend checking out the place.
