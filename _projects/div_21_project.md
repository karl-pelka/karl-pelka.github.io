My wife and I had some amazing dives with [Divers Den](https://www.diversden.com.au/) and [Silver Swift](https://www.silverseries.com.au/silverswift-cairns/) in Cairns. We saw sharks, clownfish, angelfish, turtles and a lot of corals in a lovely environment.

    Say hi to Nemo! I won't take him home to start a drama. We also had a meeting with Crush showing us around.
