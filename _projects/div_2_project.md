Coming back to the GRC conference in 2024, I managed to go diving the Friday before the conference and the weekend after the conference where I took the [Spectre Dive Boat](https://www.spectreboat.com) and got the chance to dive with sea lions as you can see below.

Moreover, we saw a lot of gigantic lobsters, a lot of Garibaldi fish, nice sea stars and swam through kelp forests.

During my stay for the GRC in 2022, my wife joined after the conference and we went diving with the [Raptor Dive Boat](https://venturadive.com/) where we explored the kelp forests around the Channel Islands.

Later during our trip, we made it to San Diego and I took the opportunity to go diving at La Jolla Cove with [Zach's Scuba Shack](https://www.zachsscubashack.com). To get diving we had to pass the sea lions chilling out at the beach lying around the people hanging out at the beach. It is a unique sight which I can only recommend to anyone who is passing by.

All in all, diving in California is an amazing and unique experience thanks to all the professional and lovely people running the operations which I hope to get back to soon.
