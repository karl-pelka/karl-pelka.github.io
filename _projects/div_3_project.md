During my visit of my former flatmate for his wedding, I took some time to go out diving around Salvador da Bahia. I have been out with multiple dive schools doing some wreck dives with Mateus of [Dive Bahia](https://www.divebahia.com.br) which I recorded. These two videos show our dive of the [Vega](https://www.naufragiosdobrasil.com.br/naufvega.htm) which we first explored and then penetrated.

On other dives I managed to see batfish and angelfish

 On the left, you can see some angelfish that live around the Vega and on the right you can see a batfish that we encountered around the harbour of Salvador.

I would also like to thank the guys of [Rebello Mergulho](https://www.rebellomergulho.com.br/), especially [Luis Felipe](https://www.instagram.com/luisf_diver) and [Bruno da Silva](https://www.rebellomergulho.com.br/staff) for taking me out for a lot of shore dives that you can see below. They taught me to listen out for the "Coral Song", the general rustle that you can hear which comes from fish eating coral and all the life in the reef.
