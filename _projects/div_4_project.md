In Summer 2023, I decided to move on in my dive training and become a PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor which requires to go through the Instructor Development Course. I decided to go through the program at [Diveshack](https://www.divemalta.com) where our Course Director [Lee](https://www.instagram.com/lee.smallwood.cassar) first discussed what our expectations were. After that, he went on to throw curveball after curveball for two weeks straight at us before we went into our Instructor Examination.
