Cirkewwa is in the north of Malta where the ferry leaves to Malta's sister island of Gozo. Next to the ferry terminal there is a marine park with special facilities and a parking lot for divers. The marine park offers multiple entries and training areas where you find plenty of marine life.

 The first picture shows an octopus we met at a training area and in the second picture shows all the damselfish you pass when you dive around the neptune grass.

To get to the patches with the neptune grass covered in fish you need to go over the drop off which still amazes me every time

In addition, there are two ship wrecks that you can reach in a dive, namely the tugboat Rozi and the P29.

It is also possible to penetrate the wrecks as you can see here.
