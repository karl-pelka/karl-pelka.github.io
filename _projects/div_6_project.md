Sliema is the touristic heart of Malta and the home of the Diveshack, where I did a lot of my training. Diving across the street of Diveshack you end up in Qui Si Sana where you can encounter a lot of different marine life.

I have seen flying gurnards, octopus, baby rays and many more at a shore that is reachable by bus in the touristic part of the island. I can only recommend anyone to check out the beach, with mask and snorkels or on scuba.

Going on for just the next bay you end up in Exiles where you can see the Tug Two:

There are so many dives and things to see in a very easy going environment so go there and check it out.
