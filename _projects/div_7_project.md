Going to the south of the Maltese islands you can find Zurrieq which is known for the Blue Grotto. Using your scuba gear shows you a whole different part of the site. There is a nice valley where the tourist ships leave for the Blue Grotto where you can do wonderful night dives. Leaving the valley there are nice reefs where you can find a lot of curious creatures like this octopus who approached us.

The biggest draw underwater however is the Um el Farroud ship wreck which is a 100 metre long oil tanker broken into two pieces

Seeing all of the wreck takes multiple dives and gives plenty of opportunities to train different skills and add gear to the dive equipment.

Penetrating the wreck is also possible as you can see in this short clip.

To sum it up, you never run out of things to see or do in Zurrieq on the surface or underwater.
