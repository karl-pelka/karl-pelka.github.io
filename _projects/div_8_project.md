Manoel Island is a micro island located between Valletta and Sliema which are the main tourist attractions of the Maltese islands. If you look from Valletta onto Manoel Island you may find that you look onto a courtyard you know from television. It turns out that you look into the Yard of the old Hospital which was used to film the decapitation of Ned Stark in Game of Thrones.


If you go to Manoel Island as a pedestrian you can go all the way to the hospital and find the ladder entering into the water there.

Diving out along the side of the Hospital will make you hit the X127 starting at 6 meter depth all the way down to 22 m.

As Manoel Island is in the bay between Sliema and Valletta it is pretty much covered from all sides from wind. This makes this site diveable nearly every day.
