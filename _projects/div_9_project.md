Leaving Malta for it's sister island Gozo makes you feel even more relaxed as Gozo is a very remote island. Going there and especially to Dwejra makes you realise that you are at the place where the Dothraki wedding of Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo took place in Game of Thrones. Only by now the rock formation, the so-called Azure Window, collapsed by now.

However, for divers underwater the collapsed rocks left a maze of gigantic rocks as you can see here

If you dive around here you usually see Mediterranean Tuna and many other fish as you can see here

Diving here genuinely feels like an underwater mountain hike with the gigantic rocks there with the sharp rock edges. It is a truly unique dive.
