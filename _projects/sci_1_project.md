The basic idea in {% cite Pelka2025 %} revolves around continuous observation.

We imagine an array of open bosonic quantum system, depicted in the left picture, that comes with specific energy levels. This makes them selectable and our suggested drive scheme achieves a Zeno effect. Effectively, a photon and phonon blockade are realised due to the clever driving scheme.

Moreover we found that this enables the creation of mechanical Fock states with a large fidelity.
