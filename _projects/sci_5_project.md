During my Master's thesis I dove into the connection of the Talbot effect and it's description through Gauss Sums which are commonly used in number theory. It turns out that a clever measurement of the intensity in the "Talbot-carpet" along a certain line measures the Gauss-Sum directly and hence it can be used to "measure" prime number decompositions which we have shown experimentally in {%cite Pelka2018%}
