I got the chance to talk about our latest work on "Routing entanglement through quantum networks" at the MQSens Workshop in Helsinki, Finland.

    I presented our work on Nonreciprocal entanglement propagation and got to see none other than the legendary Claudiu Genes.

Uros Delic gave me his highly appreciated thoughts on our work and what he would like to do in his experiments in optical tweezer arrays soon. I had lovely discussions and some revelations about physics, music, parenthood, being German and many other things with Fabian Wolf from the PTB Braunschweig. Claudiu Genes and Anja Metelmann gave me plenty of refreshers not only on the physics of quantum noise and optomechanics but all I forgot---after being a non-smoker for 7 years---on how to be a professional smoker; John Davis from the University of Alberta taught us with his contageous enthusiasm what he knows about Helium and what he wants to learn about dark matter by using Helium; and Adrian Bachtold pointed towards quantum phase transitions in their carbon nanotubes as outlined by him during his talk and his theory collaborator Fabio Pistolesi.
